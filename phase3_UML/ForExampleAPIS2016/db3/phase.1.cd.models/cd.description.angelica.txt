1. Flow - How work is divided among roles and coordinated, without regard for time
• Individuals who do the work, shown as circles
• Groups (sets of people), shown as circles
• Responsibilities of the individual or the group, shown as a list in a circle
• Flow of communication, shown as arrows and lines between individuals or groups
• Communication topics, shown as labels on the flow lines
• Artifacts, shown as small boxes on a flow
• Places, shown as large boxes
• Breakdowns in communication or coordination, shown as a red lightning bolt and annotated as necessary.

2. Sequence - The order of work tasks over time
Work tasks are ordered and unfold over time. The steps people take aren’t random;
they happen the way they do for a purpose.
• Triggers, described in sentences or blurbs
• Intents, described in sentences or blurbs
• Actions, described in sentences
• Breakdowns in doing the steps, shown as a red lightning bolt and annotated as necessary.

3. Artefact - The tangible items people create and use to help them get their work accomplished.
People create, use and modify things in the course of doing work.
These things become artifacts, which each tell their own stories.
• A visual representation of the object, either drawn, photographed, or scanned
• Presentation of the object, including relevant physical characteristics
• Information presented by the object, such as the contents of a form
• The structure, or grouping, of the parts of the object
• Annotations showing informal usage of the object, such as highlighting, post-its, etc
• A description of the object and its use, in sentences
• Breakdowns in using the artifact, shown as a red lightning bolt and annotated as necessary.
